    <h1>I am the SUPREME h tag!</h1>
    <h2>Not for long!</h2>
    <h3>Those two are always bickering. Third place ain't so bad.</h3>
    <h4>I didn't even place, but there's always next year.</h4>
    <h5>Maybe I should've used fuel with a higher octane rating...</h5>
    <h6>Wait... This was a race?</h6>

        <div>
            Hi! I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs.
            <div>
                Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent me properly.
            </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <p>
        Here's what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff.</li>
            <li>That's about it.</li>
            <li>Three's company.</li>
        </ul>
        When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not.</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag. Otherwise, use the ol tag.</li>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your items</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You've got this. I believe in you!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <p>
        Here are a couple of ways you can express yourself:
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag.</li>
            <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag.</i></li>
            <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag.</b></li>
        </ul>
        You did it! You should be proud of yourself!<br>
        <br>
        <b><i>yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF!</i></b>
